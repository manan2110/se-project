**Essentials** is a webapp which provides a platform to manage daily essential services like milk, newspaper, dairy products, poultry, or seafood items.

## What it does :

### Scope:
Our application will digitize the delivery of daily essential products. The scope of such an online marketplace is huge because every household requires daily essential products, in turn increasing the need for such applications. Convenience and quickness are the most impressive advantages of the system. It also removes the ambiguity in the billing.

### Existing System:
- Currently, there is no one-stop combined platform for these services.
- Usually, billing for these daily essential services is done manually.
- Proper record of the delivery of services is not maintained properly by the distributor and customer.


### Proposed System:
- **Login/Register:**
    - The distributors will be able to register their shops/businesses on our application and it will be visible to all our customers living within the area in which the distributor can deliver the products. 
    - Customers will be able to sign up/login into our application.
- **Automated billing:**
    - The bill of the subscription will be generated automatically. 
    - The billing will be done weekly/monthly based on the customerâ€™s preference.
- **Flexible Subscription:** 
    - Customers can subscribe to a distributor for any of their products and can schedule the delivery days (can be twice a week/monthly) according to their needs.
- **Convenient Modification:**
    - Customers can add or remove products a day before their delivery.
    - The distributor will be notified about the change such that they get sufficient time to fulfill the requirements.
- **Proper Record:**
    - A record of the delivery of services will be maintained for both the customer and distributor in this application.
- **ChatBot Feature:**
    - The bot will help the users to add and modify their subscriptions.



### Advantages of Customers:
- Customers have the flexibility to choose among different distributors
- A proper record of services delivered by the distributor is maintained for the user.
- Removes the ambiguity in the billing system.
- Reduces the wastage of money.


### Advantages of distributors:
- Proper record is maintained.
- Less wastage of products.
- Will be able to get more and more customers (Reach will increase).
- Business Expansion.


### Functional Requirements:
- The functional requirements of our system are below:
- All users on the Application (including customers and distributors) must have a user id and password to log in.
- Distributors will be able to update their quantity of products on the app.
- Customers will have full liberty to manage the services that they have subscribed to.
- Customers can add/delete/edit any service they have opted for.
- Payment for these services will be done via this application.


### Non-functional requirements:
